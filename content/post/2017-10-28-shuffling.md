I have had various online presences for the better part of 20 years.
I keep a daily journal, but very few things end up online.   I am
going to try to write more.   Both prose and code.  And with time I
will probably backfill my other attempts at writing.

Today, I have an old blog at erewhon.flatland.org.   I have my
business / consulting site at flatland.biz.   And who knows what
else.   Years ago, I had a similar situation with my various email
addresses.   Until I ended up just forwarding my half dozen consulting
and personal email addresses to one place.

With blogging and personal websites, I have used a combination of hand
written HTML and Wordpress (both hosted and self hosted).   I'm going
to try moving it all to static generation.

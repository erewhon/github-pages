Various presentations I have given, or places I've spoken.  No,
nothing earth shattering.  But since I present using HTML, might as
well dump them here for posterity.

- [Bendwood](/2016-bendwood) @ Bendwood Elementary (2016-12-12).  A
  friend of my wife's asked if I could talk to her son's computer
  class.  And oh boy did I!

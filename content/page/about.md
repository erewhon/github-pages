On this page, I attempt to explain who I am.

My name is Steven Byrnes.  See my contacts page if you want to contact
me.

Happy?  No?  Then continue reading dear reader.  (Or continue indexing
dear Googlebot.)

I have been programming, and working with computers, since the earth
cooled.  Or at least it seems that way.  It’s funny; I usually don’t
feel like an old timer. I know a lot of people who have been at it
longer than I have, but when I think about it, I started programming
(as a kid) almost 30 years ago, I’ve been using Unix & Emacs for close
to 25 years, and I’ve been using the Internet for 20 years… Well, that
makes me feel like an old timer.

I’ve worn many hats over the years in IT.  I’ve work in small
companies, as a consultant, and as a member of larger organizations.
At one point, I had a dozen languages or more on my resume: everything
from Perl and Emacs Lisp to C & assmebly (multiple flavors).  Projects
have ranged from embedded programming to web 2.0 applications & N-tier
distributed database applications.  In addition to getting my hands
dirty programming, I’ve been a database administrator (Oracle and SQL
Server), Unix administrator (mostly Solaris & Linux, but I dealt with
most major flavors at one point or another), and, even, a Windows
administrator.  (Although I’m really really rusty in that.)

But enough about the tech… for more info, you can check out my
LinkedIn page.  (Which needs a lot more fleshing out.)

INTERESTS

- photography, videography: these days, when I pick up a camera (excluding cameraphone), it’s a Canon DSLR, and I’m usually taking photos of my kids.
- travel
- lots of reading: finance, economics, business, science & technology; computer-related interests usually limited to new stuff & research
<!-- cooking: this is a relatively new one for me; I never really cooked before, but over the past half year I really have been trying out-  new recipes and learning -->
- astronomy, rarely: I keep an eye on space & astronomy stories, but I almost never look through a telescope anymore (and to think: I wanted to be an astrophysicist)

Years ago, I had a much longer list of interests on this page.  It’s
shorter now not because I have fewer interests, I just have less time.

POWERED BY

- coffee, tea, and other substances containing caffeine
- Mac
- Emacs
- <strike>the occasional cookie (chocolate chip just now)</strike>
